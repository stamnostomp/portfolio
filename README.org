* Portfolio

[[https://github.com/stamnostomp/portfolio/actions/workflows/build.yml][https://github.com/stamnostomp/portfolio/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg]]

A personal portfolio website featuring an interactive WebGL-based navigation system.

** Overview

This portfolio uses a custom "goop navigation" system where users interact with organic, fluid shapes rendered in WebGL. Hovering over different branches reveals navigation options, and clicking opens content pages with smooth transitions.

** Technical Stack

- Elm - Functional frontend language for type-safe UI
- WebGL - Real-time graphics rendering via GLSL shaders
- Tachyons - Utility-first CSS framework
- Nix - Reproducible build environment

** Architecture

*** Navigation System

The main navigation uses WebGL to render organic shapes that morph and respond to mouse input. Each "branch" of the goop represents a different section of the portfolio. Branch positions are calculated using time-based functions to create floating animations.

*** Content Display

When a branch is clicked, the application transitions to a content view. The WebGL background continues rendering while content appears in a centered rectangle. Content pages are individual Elm modules with their own styling and interactions.

*** State Management

The application uses a single Model type that tracks:
- Current transition state (showing content, transitioning in/out, or idle)
- Mouse position and hover detection
- Time for animations
- Page-specific filters and data

** Project Structure

- src/Main.elm - Main application entry point and view composition
- src/Update.elm - State updates and message handling
- src/Model.elm - Application state types
- src/Shaders/ - GLSL shader code for WebGL rendering
- src/Pages/ - Individual page modules (Blog, Projects, About, etc.)
- src/Navigation/GoopNav.elm - Navigation logic and hit detection

** Building

Build the project:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nix build
#+END_SRC

Development server:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nix develop

start dev

#+END_SRC

** Content

Blog posts are written in Org mode format and stored in blog/posts/. A custom Elm parser converts Org syntax to HTML at runtime.
